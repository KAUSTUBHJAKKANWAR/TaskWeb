            <h1>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; ">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj stands as one of the most influential and visionary leaders in Indian history. Born on February 19, 1630, at Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra, he was the son of Shahaji Bhosale and Jijabai. From a young age, Shivaji Maharaj was shaped by the turbulent times he lived in, marked by constant conflict and oppression under foreign rulers. This environment instilled in him a deep sense of justice, courage, and an unwavering commitment to the idea of Swaraj, or self-rule.</p>
<h3>Early Life and Inspiration</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px; ">
    Shivaji’s upbringing was deeply influenced by his mother, Jijabai, who instilled in him values of righteousness, bravery, and respect for all religions. He was educated in the stories of the Mahabharata and Ramayana, which helped shape his character and leadership qualities. By the age of 15, Shivaji had already demonstrated his military acumen by capturing three forts, showcasing his early strategic brilliance.

            <h1 style="font-weight: bolder;">Dharmarakhak Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; ">Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, revered as Dharmarakhak (Protector of Dharma) and Dharmaveer, was the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire and the eldest son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Born on 14 May 1657 at Purandar Fort, Maharashtra, to Shivaji and Saibai, Sambhaji's life was marked by extraordinary scholarship, valor, and an unwavering commitment to defending his people and faith.</p>
<h3>Early Life and Accession</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px; ">
   Sambhaji was a prodigious scholar, fluent in Sanskrit and several other languages.<br>

<strong>His childhood was turbulent: </strong> age nine, he was sent as a political hostage to Mughal emperor Aurangzeb’s court under the Treaty of Purandar.<br>

After returning, he faced internal family strife, particularly with his stepmother Soyarabai, who challenged his succession in favor of her own son, Rajaram.<br>

Despite these conspiracies, Sambhaji secured the throne and was crowned at Raigad Fort on 20 July 1680, following his father's death.<br>

            <h1>Swantraveer Vinayak Damodar Sawarkar</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 22px; ">Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, widely known as Swatantryaveer Savarkar or Veer Savarkar, was a pivotal figure in India’s struggle for independence and the development of modern Hindu nationalist thought. Born on 28 May 1883 in Bhagur, near Nashik, Maharashtra, Savarkar belonged to a Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin family. His early life was marked by strong nationalist influences—at just 16, he formed the Mitra Mela, a secret group dedicated to India’s complete political independence, which later became the Abhinav Bharat Society.</p>
<h3>Education and Early Activism</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px; ">
   Savarkar completed his schooling at Shivaji High School and graduated from Fergusson College in Pune. He then traveled to England to study law at Gray’s Inn Law College. While in London, Savarkar became deeply involved with revolutionary organizations such as India House and the Free India Society, both of which advocated for Indian independence through radical means.
