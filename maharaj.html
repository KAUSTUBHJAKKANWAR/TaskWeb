        <h3>Foundation of the Maratha Empire</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px;" id="info">At just 16, Shivaji began his campaign to establish a sovereign kingdom, capturing Torna Fort in 1645, which marked the beginning of the Maratha expansion. Over the years, he continued to seize strategic forts and territories, laying the foundation for what would become the Maratha Empire. His leadership was characterized by innovative guerrilla tactics, surprise attacks, and a deep understanding of the terrain, which allowed him to outmaneuver much larger and better-equipped armies.</p>


<h3>Coronation and Sovereignty</h3>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">On June 6, 1674, Shivaji was crowned Chhatrapati at Raigad Fort, formally establishing the Maratha Empire and asserting independence from Mughal rule. His coronation was a grand event attended by thousands, symbolizing the rise of a new era for the Maratha people and the Hindu majority, who saw him as a beacon of hope and resistance against oppression.<br>

<h3>Military Genius and Naval Power</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px;">Shivaji Maharaj is celebrated for his military genius. He built a formidable army and a powerful navy, earning him the title “Father of the Indian Navy”. Recognizing the strategic importance of coastal security, he developed a strong naval fleet to protect his kingdom from foreign invasions and safeguard trade routes. His use of guerrilla warfare and surprise attacks became legendary, allowing him to win battles against much larger forces.</p>


<h3>Administrative Reforms and Governance</h3>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Beyond the battlefield, Shivaji was a visionary administrator. He implemented a disciplined and efficient system of governance, dividing his empire into regions called “Prants” and establishing a council of ministers known as the “Ashtapradhan”. This council advised him on matters of revenue, justice, military, and administration, ensuring smooth and just governance. Shivaji’s policies emphasized the welfare of his subjects, religious tolerance, and the protection of all communities, regardless of caste or creed.</p>



<h3>Religious Tolerance and Social Harmony</h3>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">One of Shivaji’s most remarkable qualities was his commitment to religious tolerance. Despite being a devout Hindu, he respected and protected the places of worship of all religions, including Islam and Christianity. Many Muslims served in his administration and military, reflecting his inclusive approach to governance. He broke with tradition by welcoming relatives who had been forcibly converted back into the Hindu fold, demonstrating his progressive outlook.</p>


<h3>Legacy and Inspiration</h3>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Shivaji Maharaj’s legacy extends far beyond his military and administrative achievements. He inspired generations to fight for freedom, justice, and self-respect. His vision of Hindavi Swarajya—self-rule for the people—continues to resonate in modern India. He breathed new life into a society that had resigned itself to foreign domination and led a movement that eventually challenged the might of the Mughal Empire.</p>
