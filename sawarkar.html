        <h3>Revolutionary Activities and Imprisonment</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px;">Savarkar’s activism extended to writing: his book The Indian War of Independence, 1857 argued that the 1857 rebellion was the first organized struggle for Indian freedom. The British government banned this work, viewing it as seditious. In 1910, Savarkar was arrested for his revolutionary activities and extradited to India. During his transport, he made a daring escape attempt at the port of Marseille, France, but was recaptured and handed back to the British.<br>

He was sentenced to two life terms totaling fifty years and sent to the infamous Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. After years of harsh imprisonment and several mercy petitions, he was released in 1924 but was kept under strict surveillance and restrictions.</p>


        <h3>Ideology and Political Career</h3>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Savarkar’s most enduring legacy is the development of the Hindutva ideology, which he articulated to foster a collective Hindu identity as the essence of Indian nationhood. He was a prominent leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, advocating for Hindu political and social unity and the concept of a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Nation). Despite being an atheist himself, Savarkar pragmatically promoted Hindu philosophy and culture.<br>

He was also the first to describe the 1857 uprising as India’s first war of independence and introduced the controversial two-nation theory in his writings, which posited Hindus and Muslims as separate nations.</p>


<h3>Later Years and Legacy</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px;">After his release, Savarkar became a prolific writer, orator, and political leader. He criticized the Indian National Congress’s approach during the Quit India Movement and advocated a more assertive stance against British rule. In 1948, he was implicated as a co-conspirator in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi but was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

Savarkar died on <strong>26 February 1966 </strong>in Bombay (now Mumbai) at the age of 82. His contributions remain a subject of debate and discussion in Indian society and politics, especially after the resurgence of interest in his legacy following the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>


<h3>Why He Is Admired</h3>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Savarkar is admired for his unwavering courage, intellectual rigor, and pioneering role in India’s freedom movement. His willingness to endure extreme hardship for his beliefs, his vision of a united and self-reliant India, and his advocacy for social reform and national pride continue to inspire many. While his views on nationalism and religion are debated, his commitment to Indian independence and his contributions to political thought are widely recognized.</p>
