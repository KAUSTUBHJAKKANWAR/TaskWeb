        <h3>Reign and Military Campaigns</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px;">Sambhaji’s reign (1681–1689) was dominated by relentless warfare, especially against the Mughal Empire led by Aurangzeb.<br>

He led the Marathas in the Battle of Burhanpur (1681), a daring raid on a major Mughal trade center, and orchestrated the six-year Siege of Ramsej, showcasing his military acumen and resilience.<br>

He also fought campaigns in Konkan against the Siddis and Portuguese, fiercely opposing the forced conversions and destruction of temples in Goa.<br>

His leadership ensured that Aurangzeb, despite his vast resources, was unable to conquer the Maratha heartland, keeping the Mughal emperor occupied in the Deccan for nearly three decades.</p>


        <h3>Scholarship and Administration</h3>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Sambhaji was not only a warrior but also a learned writer and thinker, authoring works in Sanskrit and other languages.<br>

He prioritized the welfare of his subjects, launching attacks on Mughal strongholds to alleviate poverty and food shortages in his kingdom.<br>

His reign was marked by a commitment to protecting Hindu culture and reconverting those forcibly converted by foreign powers.<br></p>


<h3>Martyrdom and Legacy</h3>

<p style="font-size: 22px;">In 1689, Sambhaji was betrayed, captured by Mughal forces, and subjected to brutal torture for over 40 days. Despite this, he refused to convert to Islam or betray his principles.<br>

His execution at Tulapur became a rallying point for Maratha resistance, inspiring his successors and subjects to continue the fight, which ultimately led to the resurgence of Hindu rule in North India.<br></p>


<h3>Why He Is Remembered as Dharmarakhak</h3>
<p style="font-size: 22px;">Sambhaji Maharaj is celebrated for his uncompromising defense of Dharma (righteousness) and his refusal to submit to religious persecution.<br>

His sacrifice, scholarship, and indomitable spirit have made him a symbol of courage and steadfastness in the face of overwhelming adversity.<br></p>

<p style="font-size: 22px;">"Sambhaji Maharaj was a true Dharmaveer, who just like his father Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, did not bow before Aurangzeb although Aurangzeb brutally tortured Sambhaji Maharaj for more than 40 days. Hindus must learn how to sacrifice for Dharma from Sambhaji Maharaj."</p>
